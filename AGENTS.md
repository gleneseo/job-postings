## Local Effect Source

The Effect v4 repository is cloned to `~/.local/share/vendors/effect` for reference. Use this to explore APIs,
find usage examples, and understand implementation details when the documentation isn't enough.

## Commit messages

All commits must follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) convention:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

Common `type` values: `feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `build`, `ci`.

Use `!` after the type/scope (or a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer) to indicate a breaking change.

## Branching

Never commit directly to `master`. All changes must go through a pull request from a feature branch.

## Git stash

Any `git stash` operation must include untracked files (i.e. pass `-u`/`--include-untracked`).

## Test naming

All test labels (e.g. the string passed to `it`/`test`) must start with "should". For example, "should return a truthy value", or "should find a user".

## Code documentation

IMPORTANT: Code documentation must follow [TSDoc](https://tsdoc.org/) conventions.

Documentation strings must never end in a `.`, unless they include multiple phrases (e.g. multiple sentences), in which case every phrase, including the last, ends in a `.`.
